A social media android app dedicated for Students. This app provides a platform to students to engage with other students and help each other academically. It functions just like
any other social media app.   
The app uses Firebase realtime database, storage and authentication to support its features and is developed by me [(Saifullah)](https://github.com/saifullah73) and my friend [Abdul Hafeez Sajid](https://github.com/abdulhafeez176)
